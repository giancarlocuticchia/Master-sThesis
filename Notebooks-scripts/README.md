## Content of this folder

We separated our work in Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts. More information inside their respective folders.

The Jupyter Notebooks are inside the "[Notebooks](../Notebooks-scripts/Notebooks)" folder. They were made in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and should be usable as a regular Jupyter Notebook would. Each of them explain step by a step how to perform the tasks we did with them.

The Python scripts are inside the "[Scripts](../Notebooks-scripts/Scripts)" folder. They require some setup, where the user needs to modify them to properly assign the variables and paths to files to use with the script. They are meant to be used on a terminal, like:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

Whereby the user is required to install beforehand the corresponding Python libraries that the script requires to operate.
